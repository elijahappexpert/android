This is the Disaster Events Android App Repository

This contains the complete code to implement the disaster events android app from top to bottom. 
It is meant as an educational piece for the puspose of helping developers make the leap from textbook exercises
to publishing a real app in the app store, therefore the code is well formatted, and heavily documented.

There is a support site for this app which can be found here: http://www.versaggi.biz/ , which includes development
docs, architecture notes, and more.
